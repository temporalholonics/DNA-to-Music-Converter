# DNA-to-Music-Converter
A program that converts DNA to music

The basis of the DNA-Music conversion is based on convergence in emotional values between neurotransmitters and musical tones. Major neurotransmitters have consistent emotions associated with them, as do major musical notes. This formed the basis of our cypher. 


Dopamine is from L-Tyrosine

UAC
UAU

Serotonin is from 5-Hydroxytryptophan (tryptophan)

UGG

GABA is from Glutamate

GAG
GAA

Acetylcholine is from choline is from methionine & serine

Methionine:

AUG
ATG

Serine

AGU
AGC
TCT
TCC
TCA
TCG

The following is some basic research into appropriate musical analogues:

There are many musical elements that can be associated with emotions such as happiness, pleasure, reward, motivation, excitement, or contentment. Some examples include:

-Upbeat tempo
-Major key tonality
-Bright and light timbres
-Simplicity and repetition in melody and harmony
-Use of rhythmic syncopation and strong beats
-Use of positive lyrics

It's worth noting that the association of music and emotions is subjective, and what one person finds pleasurable or motivating may not be the same for another person.

There are many musical elements that can be associated with emotions such as feeling of well-being and contentment, feeling of calmness and tranquility, reduced feelings of anxiety and stress, improved mood and sense of happiness, and feeling of satisfaction after eating. Some examples include:

Slow tempo
Major key tonality
Smooth and legato phrasing
Gentle and consonant harmony
Soothing timbres
Use of ambient and nature-inspired sounds
Use of positive and uplifting lyrics
It's worth noting that the association of music and emotions is subjective, and what one person finds soothing or calming may not be the same for another person.

There are many musical elements that can be associated with feelings of relaxation, calmness, reduced anxiety and stress, promotion of sleep, reduced nervousness and reduced muscle tension. Some examples include:

Slow tempo
Minor key tonality
Gentle and consonant harmony
Gentle and smooth melody
Soothing timbres
Use of ambient and nature-inspired sounds
Use of calming and meditative lyrics
Use of white noise, nature sounds, and binaural beats.
It's worth noting that the association of music and emotions is subjective, and what one person finds relaxing or calming may not be the same for another person. Additionally, listening to music can be used as an adjuvant therapy for promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety, stress and muscle tension, but should not be used as a substitute for other medical treatments.

There are many musical elements that can be associated with feelings such as increased focus and concentration, improved memory and learning, increased wakefulness and alertness, improved muscle control and coordination, and increased sexual arousal. Some examples include:

-Upbeat tempo

Major key tonality
Bright and light timbres
Complex and varied melody and harmony
Use of rhythmic syncopation and strong beats
Use of lyrics that inspire and motivate
Use of music specifically designed to improve focus, such as binaural beats or neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) music.
It's worth noting that the association of music and emotions is subjective, and what one person finds motivating or arousing may not be the same for another person. Additionally, using music as a cognitive enhancer or memory aid has shown some promising results, but more research is needed to fully understand the effects and the best way to use it.

GABA

Based on some consultation, the following notes were chosen because they are harmonious with each other
major neurotransmitters were assigned based on the artist's subjective association - other associations may work better. 
 
GABA Earth Gminor 	
GAG	337hz
GAA

Serotonin Water Cminor 
UGG	370hz

Dopamine Fire Amajor
UAC	440 Hz

Acetylcholine Air Bmajor Dmajor
UCU	494

AGU	587
AGC

First two letters:
GA = 337 - percussion
UG = 370 - string
UA = 440 - brass
UC = 494 - wind
AG = 587 - wind

As GA =/= AG, order clearly matters. notes were assigned according to the following formula:
G+AX = 337
U+GX = 370
U+AX = 440
U+CX = 494
A+GX = 587

Notes not mentioned here were assigned based on the solution to the above set of linear equations. An alternative version followed the format G*(A+X)=337, but this produced a less pleasant sound.
